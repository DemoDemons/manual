# Stage Maker
You can use the Stage Maker to create stages that players can play during rounds. 

## Stage tab
### Saving your stage
To save your stage, go to **Stage** > **Save Stage**. You can automatically save when you leave by going to **Stage** > **Settings** > **Saving** > **Attempt to automatically save my stage when everyone leaves**.

> [!WARNING]
> Avoid editing your stage while saving. If you do, be sure to save again. 

### Publishing your stage
To start the publishing process, go to **Stage** > **Publish stage**. This will save your stage, then put it into the stage database. 

> [!NOTE]
> In a v1.0.0, there will be an additional step: a jury must approve your stage before it's sent to the stage database.
